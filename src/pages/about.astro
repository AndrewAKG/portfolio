  <p>
    Hey! Iâ€™m a <strong>Senior Backend Engineer & AWS Architect</strong> who loves designing reliable, observable cloud systems
    and helping teams ship with confidence. My work blends backend engineering with DevOps practices to turn ideas into
    scalable, cost-aware platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work primarily with <strong>TypeScript/Node.js</strong> on an <strong>AWS-first</strong> stack using
    Terraform, CloudFormation, and Serverless Framework, containers with ECS/Fargate and Docker, and data stores like
    RDS/PostgreSQL and DynamoDB. I design event-driven systems with SQS/SNS and EventBridge, build CI/CD with GitHub Actions,
    and instrument everything for metrics, logs, and alerts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond feature work, I enjoy mentoring, clear documentation and runbooks, and architecture diagrams that align teams on
    trade-offs and outcomes. My approach: ship small, automate relentlessly, measure outcomes, iterate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside work, I love travelling, playing table tennis, football, and swimming.
  </p>
